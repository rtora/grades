# Grades GitHub Repository

## Project Overview
This repository contains grades data from various University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) campuses. The data encompasses academic records from the years 2000 to 2022. Each row in the dataset represents a class offered in a specific academic term, along with the count of each type of grade awarded for that class.

## Data Acquisition
### How was this data obtained?
The data was obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and a California Public Records Request.

### Data Accuracy
While I can personally verify some of the data (e.g., being the only recipient of an A+ in UCSB’s PSTAT 197A for Fall 2020, as reflected in the data), complete accuracy of the entire dataset cannot be guaranteed.

## Data Updates
### How often will the data be updated?
The data will be updated annually at the beginning of each year. The data for the 2023 academic year has already been requested.

## Missing Data
### Why isn’t data from my school included?
Requests were made for data from every UC and CSU. However, some institutions did not respond, while others requested payment, which was not feasible due to budget constraints. If you wish to fund data acquisition from your university, please contact me. Below is a list of schools from which data was not obtained, including reasons and requested payments:

- UC Riverside: No response
- UCSF: Data not readily available
- CSU Bakersfield: $1,920
- CSU Dominguez Hills: No response
- Fresno State: $1,950
- CSU Fullerton: $14,400
- CSU Long Beach: $1,398
- CAL Maritime: No response
- CSU Monterey Bay: $186.24
- CSUN: Data available in PDF (conversion to CSV needed)
- San Diego State: $5,000
- Cal Poly San Luis Obispo: $5,000 (all data), $2,500 (last 3 years)
- Sonoma State: $900
- Stanislaus State: No response

## Contributing
### How can I add data for my school?
You can contribute by creating a git merge or sending me an email with the data.
